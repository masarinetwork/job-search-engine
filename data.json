paid All of these companies out there offering 95 1 50 plus FSC per mile are making approximately 2 00 4 00 per mile on your truck after your cut and that is ridiculous This is the opportunity for you to get a fair percentage of daily market rates in what is more than likely the best market and economy most of us have ever seen in our professional careers The consumer is spending unemployment is lower than what it has been in 48 years and freight is moving at incredible volume and the rates are higher than they have ever been in our industry If the carrier you are signed on with isn t showing you these kind of rates then one of two things are happening 1 they are hauling extremely cheap freight or 2 they are not being honest with you about how much they are being paid probably the second scenario You should be running for a minimum of 2 00 per mile to your truck after the carrier s cut and that is a minimum of 2 00 per mile Most of the time you should be making more than 2 00 per mile

"description": "QR Code Link to This Post I m not here to sell you on an opportunity because I know this is the best financial sales niche out there I am here to tell you my story At a young age I watched my father make 100K year in a sales job I was convinced that I too would be in some type of sales position After playing college football becoming a firefighter and working a dead end corporate W2 sales job I discovered financial services I stumbled upon a Craigslist ad promising the ability to set my own hours and earn a six figure income the first year I accepted the interview ended up knowing the manager and was told that it was all a numbers game and that I could make as much money as I wanted My introduction to life insurance sales was using mortgage protection as a way to sell Term Life insurance to new home owners I purchased about 30 leads costing approximately 1000 per week Hundreds of phone calls were made just to set up my week This generated about 10 appointments which in turn resulted in 2 3 qualified prospects and one or two sales and yes I made a lot of money However my year end 1099 found me questioning how much money I really made My overhead with lead cost and office rent cut into nearly HALF of my revenue Then there were the chargebacks which seemed to be a weekly occurrence In most cases the money had already been spent This type of transactional sale did not generate loyalty since the client was shopping around for the cheapest possible plan It seemed like a good idea to add Final Expense to my portfolio of clients to service These are typically really old and unhealthy people looking to secure an insurance plan to cover their funeral Most of the people I actually got in touch with were either not home for our scheduled appointment or didn t even have a bank account to pay the monthly premium with All in all I still managed to make a decent income for myself at the cost of having no social life driving all over the state and rarely arriving at home before 11 00 p m Not to mention putting in full days on Saturdays to attempt catching potential clients at home who were dodging my phone calls I was taught to use these appointments as a way to uncover assets and cross sell the clients an annuity Once again this was added to my sales portfolio The older clients did have money but they also had 3 4 other people trying to sell them annuities as well The younger clients who had money typically had it wrapped up into a 401K where I couldn t touch it until they were 59 1 2 years old Everything seemed to be going great until my mentors CEO s of the IMO I was working with left and said they had found a better opportunity I was uncertain of what this meant for me I was faced with a decision to leave a gig where I was finally making Real Money for the unknown All they kept saying was that I would work half as much and make twice as much And they were even willing to pay me from their own pocket if it didn t live up to those expectations It was 2014 when we found Appreciation Financial This company has contracts with public schools municipalities and now private sector employers to be able to service their employees retirement needs They got rid of BUYING LEADS and had more prospects than I could even have time to help all beneath one roof Think about it How many schools alone are near your neighborhood Within each school there is an average of 100 employees They are severely under educated on how their pensions and retirement plans work Most importantly they ALL need our help We educate them as an APPROVED Retirement provider and sell a ton of retirement products and help them with their life insurance We are able to MOVE IN SERVICE MONEY need I say more We work normal hours since we meet most at their place of business We are their trusted advisors on a restricted approved list with a badge They actually care about their retirement and we aren t using back door methods like selling a final expense plan to uncover money This conversation planning their golden years of retirement is much more enjoyable than talking about how their funeral cost will be paid Marketing for clients is the easiest part of this business and we have many highly effective ways to fill up your calendar with qualified prospects My journey has evolved into building a team to help me service all of these people My present team is comprised of about 100 agents across the country and includes all my best friends mother and other family members The best part is that we haven t even scratched the surface There s nothing holding you back should you choose to build an agency the comp plan is built for this opportunity In addition to the residual income owning your book of business the multiple 6 or 7 figure incomes we are truly making a difference in those lives that we touch We have an amazing culture which we call Home No more jumping around from IMO to IMO No more no shows no more chargebacks and no more lead debt Life is good We are looking for producers and or agencies who Have made over 80 000 in a year in a 1099 position Currently have a life insurance license or can obtain one Are great connecting with people Have confidence and can sell in a low pressure environment Are able to be self directed and motivated Have a growth mindset Are passionate about educating those that need you help Are ambitious and desire a multiple six figure income and beyond If this resonates with you reply to this post with your work history and we ll get in touch with you", "hiredBy":

08:01", "description": "QR Code Link to This Post I m not here to sell you on an opportunity because I know this is the best financial sales niche out there I am here to tell you my story At a young age I watched my father make 100K year in a sales job I was convinced that I too would be in some type of sales position After playing college football becoming a firefighter and working a dead end corporate W2 sales job I discovered financial services I stumbled upon a Craigslist ad promising the ability to set my own hours and earn a six figure income the first year I accepted the interview ended up knowing the manager and was told that it was all a numbers game and that I could make as much money as I wanted My introduction to life insurance sales was using mortgage protection as a way to sell Term Life insurance to new home owners I purchased about 30 leads costing approximately 1000 per week Hundreds of phone calls were made just to set up my week This generated about 10 appointments which in turn resulted in 2 3 qualified prospects and one or two sales and yes I made a lot of money However my year end 1099 found me questioning how much money I really made My overhead with lead cost and office rent cut into nearly HALF of my revenue Then there were the chargebacks which seemed to be a weekly occurrence In most cases the money had already been spent This type of transactional sale did not generate loyalty since the client was shopping around for the cheapest possible plan It seemed like a good idea to add Final Expense to my portfolio of clients to service These are typically really old and unhealthy people looking to secure an insurance plan to cover their funeral Most of the people I actually got in touch with were either not home for our scheduled appointment or didn t even have a bank account to pay the monthly premium with All in all I still managed to make a decent income for myself at the cost of having no social life driving all over the state and rarely arriving at home before 11 00 p m Not to mention putting in full days on Saturdays to attempt catching potential clients at home who were dodging my phone calls I was taught to use these appointments as a way to uncover assets and cross sell the clients an annuity Once again this was added to my sales portfolio The older clients did have money but they also had 3 4 other people trying to sell them annuities as well The younger clients who had money typically had it wrapped up into a 401K where I couldn t touch it until they were 59 1 2 years old Everything seemed to be going great until my mentors CEO s of the IMO I was working with left and said they had found a better opportunity I was uncertain of what this meant for me I was faced with a decision to leave a gig where I was finally making Real Money for the unknown All they kept saying was that I would work half as much and make twice as much And they were even willing to pay me from their own pocket if it didn t live up to those expectations It was 2014 when we found Appreciation Financial This company has contracts with public schools municipalities and now private sector employers to be able to service their employees retirement needs They got rid of BUYING LEADS and had more prospects than I could even have time to help all beneath one roof Think about it How many schools alone are near your neighborhood Within each school there is an average of 100 employees They are severely under educated on how their pensions and retirement plans work Most importantly they ALL need our help We educate them as an APPROVED Retirement provider and sell a ton of retirement products and help them with their life insurance We are able to MOVE IN SERVICE MONEY need I say more We work normal hours since we meet most at their place of business We are their trusted advisors on a restricted approved list with a badge They actually care about their retirement and we aren t using back door methods like selling a final expense plan to uncover money This conversation planning their golden years of retirement is much more enjoyable than talking about how their funeral cost will be paid Marketing for clients is the easiest part of this business and we have many highly effective ways to fill up your calendar with qualified prospects My journey has evolved into building a team to help me service all of these people My present team is comprised of about 100 agents across the country and includes all my best friends mother and other family members The best part is that we haven t even scratched the surface There s nothing holding you back should you choose to build an agency the comp plan is built for this opportunity In addition to the residual income owning your book of business the multiple 6 or 7 figure incomes we are truly making a difference in those lives that we touch We have an amazing culture which we call Home No more jumping around from IMO to IMO No more no shows no more chargebacks and no more lead debt Life is good We are looking for producers and or agencies who Have made over 80 000 in a year in a 1099 position Currently have a life insurance license or can obtain one Are great connecting with people Have confidence and can sell in a low pressure environment Are able to be self directed and motivated Have a growth mindset Are passionate about educating those that need you help Are ambitious and desire a multiple six figure income and beyond If this resonates with you reply to this post with your work history and we ll get in touch with you", "hiredBy":
